# Add to RESAMPLE_DEFINES the relevant options for your desired
# implementation and/or third-party library support.
#
# Available library options are
#
#  -DHAVE_LIBSAMPLERATE  The libsamplerate library is available (recommended)
#  -DHAVE_IPP            Intel's Integrated Performance Primitives are available
#  -DHAVE_LIBRESAMPLE    The libresample library is available
#  -DUSE_BQRESAMPLER     Compile the built-in BQ resampler (pretty good)
#  -DUSE_SPEEX           Compile the built-in Speex-derived resampler
#
# You may define more than one of these, and the implementation used
# will depend on the quality setting you request - but it is usually
# better to stick with a single known library. If no flags are
# supplied, the code will refuse to compile.
#

# Add to VECTOR_DEFINES and ALLOCATOR_DEFINES any options desired for
# the bqvec library (that are not already defined in RESAMPLE_DEFINES).
# See the bqvec build documentation for more details.

# THIRD_PARTY_LIBS if using libsamplerate)
